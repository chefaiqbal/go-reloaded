Plan:

Read the input file that contains the text to be modified.
Parse the modifications specified in the text using the provided rules.
Apply the modifications to the text.
Write the modified text to the output file.


Read the input file:

Accept the input and output file names as command-line arguments.
Open and read the contents of the input file into a string variable.
Parse the modifications:

Define a function that takes the text as input and returns the modified text.
Iterate over the text and search for the specified modifications.
Use regular expressions or string manipulation to identify and extract the modification details.
Apply the appropriate modification based on the rules provided.
Apply modifications:

Implement functions for each modification type:
Convert hexadecimal to decimal: ConvertHexToDecimal(hex string) string
Convert binary to decimal: ConvertBinaryToDecimal(binary string) string
Convert to uppercase: ConvertToUppercase(word string) string
Convert to lowercase: ConvertToLowercase(word string) string
Capitalize a word: CapitalizeWord(word string) string
Apply case modification to a specific number of words: ModifyWordsCase(text string, caseType string, wordCount int) string
Apply the corresponding modification function based on the parsed modifications.
Write the modified text to the output file:

Open the output file for writing.
Write the modified text to the output file.
Test and validate:

Create test cases to cover different scenarios, including various modifications and edge cases.
Write unit tests for the functions you have implemented.
Validate the correctness of the output against the expected results.
